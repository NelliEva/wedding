        As you all know we met in Seoul, South-Korea in 2019. One of us coming from South Brunswick, New Jersey, the other is from Budapest, Hungary / Paris, France. The chances that we will meet on the 29th of November in 2019 in Korea was extremely low. But we like to think that this is proove also that we were meaant to be together. As some of you heard our first-meeting story, you know that we met on an odrinary Friday night in one of Itaewon famous bar. One of us was celebrating Thanksgiving with their friends, the other was enjoying her first Seoul night out with a friend. And the magic happened.

         <p >Unfortionatly we had to spent 6 months appart, because we could not stay for ever in Korea and the closing borders because of Covid made it impossible to be together. But that 6 months appart reassured us that we want to stay together. As hard it was this 6 months, the reunion when finally came was amazing. We could spend Christmas together in El Paso where we currently live. And finally the new year came and with it a new puppy joined in our house. The idea of puppy with name the Kimchi was born already in Korea, where we dreamnt about having a cute golden retriever, so when we had a chance to adopt this amazing golden we jumped on it immedietly.Our familly is very multinational we are  hungarian, american and thanks to our beautiful boy, now mexican too. </p>

   	   <p class="thirdtext">After spending sole time in together here in El Paso we decided we want to spend the rest of our lives together. The proposal was at the White Sands National Park in New Mexico. After a long thinking and planning we realized this will be a perfect place for an intimate wedding-elopement. We have so many great memories here and this place is very close to our heart. </p>

But to still will be able to share this beautiful day with you we decided to broadcast our ceremony. So in a waay you all will be with us.
